I enjoy solving problems using Software. I have created code for a lot of kind of devices and machines: servers, PCs, mobiles, microcontrollers, PLCs, ... This fact has made to deal with a lot of kind of problems and paradigms, but always taking into account scalability, resilience and fault tolerance. You can find my code running in a data center, in your mobile phone or even in an airport. My Background is in Telecom therefore I like the projects that involve real-time, networking, messaging, concurrency and so on.
I also like to share my knowledge publishing posts in my blog and releasing my open source projects.
