# Gonzalo Gabriel Jiménez Fuentes

I enjoy solving problems using Software and helping people to do the same, guiding them or through training. I have developed a wide range of projects, this fact has made me to deal with a large range of problems and paradigms, but always taking into account scalability, resilience and fault tolerance. My software systems are currently running in data center, in mobile phones or even in airports. I consider myself a team player which always helps every person involved in the project to success. My Background is in Telecom therefore I like the projects that involve real-time, networking, messaging, concurrency and so on. I also like to share my knowledge publishing posts in blogs and releasing my open source projects.
