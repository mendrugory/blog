# Gonzalo Gabriel Jiménez Fuentes

__Software Development and DevOps Consultant__

I enjoy solving problems using Software and helping people to do the same, guiding them or
through training. I have created code for very different devices and machines: servers, PCs,
mobiles, microcontrollers, PLCs and so on. This fact has made to deal with a large range of
problems and paradigms, but always taking into account scalability, resilience and fault tolerance.
You can find my code running in a data center, in your mobile phone or even in an airport. I
consider myself a team player which always helps every member of the team to success. My
Background is in Telecom therefore I like the projects that involve real-time, networking,
messaging, concurrency and so on. I also like to share my knowledge publishing posts in blogs and
releasing my open source projects.
