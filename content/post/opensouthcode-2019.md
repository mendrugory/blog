[Opensouthcode](https://www.opensouthcode.org) is an event whose target is to promote open source code technologies and is based on MÃ¡laga (Spain).

This year I was there talking about *Infrastructure as code* using *Terraform* and showing some examples that were deployed to *AWS*: from a simple server to a *Kubernetes* cluster.
