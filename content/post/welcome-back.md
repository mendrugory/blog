# New Web, let's start again

I have been offline for a lot of months, but it does not mean that I have been doing nothing (just the opposite). One of the things that I wanted to do is to move my blog from Weebly. It was not bad, but the writing experience was a bit unpleasure. After being experimenting with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and writing in Markdown I decided to do the same with my blog.

I have been also using the nickname _mendrugory_ since I had access to Internet, using hotmail and gmail emails accounts, but I never bought the domain.

Otherwise, today everything changed. I extracted all the info from my old blog using this [code](https://github.com/mendrugory/weebly-scraper), I created a hugo project, I bought the domain and I deployed it using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (by the way, really easy tool).

Moving my [cv](https://mendrugory.github.io) into this website is in my _To-Do list_.

I will try to post more frequently.
